# CSS Art & Factorial Calculator  

This project merges the creativity of **CSS art** with the functionality of a **factorial calculator** that supports both **iterative** and **recursive** methods. Developed as part of my **web development internship at VirtuNexa**, this project reflects my learning journey and the practical application of **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.

## üé® CSS Art  
- A series of **CSS-based art** designs created without the use of images or external resources.  
- Showcases how **pure CSS** can be used for creating visually engaging web elements.

## üî¢ Factorial Calculator  
- A calculator that computes the factorial of a number entered by the user.  
- Implements both **iterative** and **recursive** approaches to showcase different methods of calculation.  
- Provides real-time results with an easy-to-use interface.

## üöÄ Technologies Used  
- **HTML**: For the structure of the webpage.  
- **CSS**: To create the visual art and style the page.  
- **JavaScript**: To implement the factorial calculator's functionality.

## üèÅ Conclusion  
This project serves as a demonstration of my ability to combine creative design with functional web development. It allowed me to experiment with **CSS** for artistic expression and to develop logical solutions for real-world problems using **JavaScript**. I look forward to expanding this project with additional features and enhancing the user experience as I continue my journey in web development.
